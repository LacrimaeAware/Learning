# Learning
 Practicing learning programming concepts such as webdev. 

**#1 Goal **- Working towards creating a website, and develop web related skills.

**#2 Goal **- Develop general programming skills as interest sees fit. Examples: creating a small game, music, a twitch bot, a program to troll people, hacking Elon Musk's bank account. 

The most important thing is maintain interest, consistency, and working on something.

What we'll be doing to achieve this:

1. Small tasks most days, aiming for at least 5 minutes spent on the project.
   
2. Focusing on a work first, figure out later strategy. Use AI frequently to keep moving forward/learning when clueless.
