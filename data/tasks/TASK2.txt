[PRETEXT]

Remember to ask AI for help if you need, or me.
You are free to name things, and organize files within your folder however you’d like.
Some extra command line help at the bottom. 

[STEPS]

1. Clone the repository
	File -> Clone repository
	Put in URL of this repository:  https://github.com/LacrimaeAware/Learning

	If you wanted to do it via command line git, ask the AI but for now:
		Git clone https://github.com/LacrimaeAware/Learning.git
		Navigate into the directory with cd learning

2. Create a folder named after you in some way (an identifier) within the COLLABORATOR folder. 
Ex: C:\Users\EcceNihilum\Desktop\Learning Prog with J & S\Learning\COLLABORATORS\Fernardo\

3. Create a file within your folder named index.html
4. Open the file and add some basic HTML content.
	EX:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<Title>My First Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
		<p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
	</body>
	</html>
5. On GitHub Desktop it should automatically detect new changes. Under changes enter a commit message in the text box, “Added personal folder and HTML file”. 
6. Click Commit to main. 
7. After committing, click the Push origin button.
