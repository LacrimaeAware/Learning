[PRETEXT]
Today, let's expand our basic HTML page. Here is an optional resource for understanding HTML tags and attributes: W3Schools HTML Basics. At the bottom, I will include a succinct explanation of HTML structure and placement.
[STEPS]
Get a Code Editor:
If you don’t have one, download a beginner-friendly code editor. Recommended:
Visual Studio Code - Versatile, with great support.
Sublime Text - Fast and efficient.
Atom - Good for collaboration.
Brackets - Features live preview for CSS.
Notepad++ - Simple, effective for Windows.
Open HTML File with Code Editor:
Open the index.html file you created.
Add an Image and Style It:
Use any web URL or a local image file. For a web URL:
html
Copy code
<img src="https://placekitten.com/408/287" alt="Kitten" style="width:200px;height:150px;">


For a local image:
html
Copy code
<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="My Image" style="width:200px;height:150px;">


Add a Link and Style It:
Create a hyperlink to any website and style it:
html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com" style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Visit Example!</a>


Add a Simple List and Style It:
Make a bullet point list and add CSS styles inline:
html
Copy code
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li style="color: blue;">Item One</li>
  <li style="color: green;">Item Two</li>
  <li style="color: purple;">Item Three</li>
</ul>


Save and Preview Your Page:
Save changes and view your HTML file in a browser to see how the styles change the appearance.
Commit and Push Your Changes:
Use GitHub Desktop to commit with the message “Enhanced HTML with images, links, lists, and CSS styles” and push to the repository.
HTML Structure and Placement
HTML documents consist of a <head> for metadata like titles and CSS links, and a <body> for all content visible on the webpage.
Order in the <body> determines the visual order on the page. Elements appear as listed from top to bottom.
Nesting elements like <div> or <ul> groups content or organizes items into lists.
Optimizing loading: Place <script> tags at the end of the <body> to prevent blocking the page rendering.
Mini FAQ on HTML Placement
Does element order affect the webpage?
Yes, elements render in the order they appear in the HTML.
Where should images and links be placed?
Place <img> and <a> tags within the <body> where you want them to display.
What about <script> tags in the <head>?
Placing <script> tags at the end of the <body> improves loading times by preventing render blocking.
