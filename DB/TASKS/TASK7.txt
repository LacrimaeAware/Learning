Task: Introduction to CSS for Enhancing Webpage Visual Appeal
Steps:
Open Your HTML File:
Open the index.html file in your code editor.
Link CSS File:
Confirm that styles.css is linked in the <head> section of your index.html.
Basic Styling:
In styles.css, add styles to improve the readability and appearance of the webpage.
css
Copy code
/* Sets background color, font type, text color, and line spacing for the entire page */
body {
    background-color: #f0f2f5;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
    line-height: 1.6;
}
/* Styles for main heading */
h1 {
    color: #026476;
    text-align: center;
}
/* Styles for subheadings */
h2 {
    color: #014451;
}


Style Media Elements:
Add CSS to format video and audio players, and forms.
css
Copy code
/* Ensures video and audio elements are centered and responsive */
video, audio {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Center align */
    max-width: 100%; /* Ensures it doesn't overflow its container */
}
/* Styles the form with a background, padding for spacing, border for definition, and center alignment */
form {
    background: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    margin: 20px auto; /* Adds margin above and below the form */
    width: 50%; /* Limits form width for better readability */
}


Save and Preview Your Page:
Save the changes and open your index.html in a web browser.
Commit and Push Your Changes:
Commit your changes with the message "Applied basic CSS styling to the webpage" and push them to your repository.
Helpful Tips:
CSS Linking: Ensure <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> is correctly placed within the <head> tag of your HTML to correctly apply styles.
Color Codes: Use hexadecimal or RGB color codes for more precise color selection in your CSS.
Max-width in CSS: Using max-width for media ensures content responsiveness, preventing it from exceeding the width of its container, which is crucial for mobile responsiveness.
Form Styling: Styling forms with padding, margins, and width not only improves aesthetics but also enhances user interaction by making elements easier to read and click.
