Step 1: Review HTML Elements
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. HTML uses elements, often called tags, to structure and give meaning to the content. Let's explore the most common HTML elements you've used in your webpage:
1. <html>
Purpose: This element wraps the entire content of a webpage. It is the root element and contains all other HTML elements (except for <!DOCTYPE>).
2. <head>
Purpose: This element contains meta-information about the webpage, like its title, links to stylesheets, and character set declarations. It doesn’t display content directly on the web page.
3. <title>
Purpose: This specifies the title of the webpage, which is shown in the browser's title bar or tab. It's important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and user experience.
4. <body>
Purpose: This element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc., that are displayed as part of the web page.
5. Headings: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>
Purpose: These represent different levels of headings and subheadings on your webpage. <h1> is the highest (main) level and should be used for the primary title of your page, possibly only once. <h2>, <h3>, and lower levels (<h4>, <h5>, <h6>) represent sub-sections with decreasing importance. Proper use improves SEO and accessibility.
6. <p>
Purpose: Defines a paragraph; it's a block element that represents a block of text. It’s one of the most common elements and helps break content into manageable sections.
7. <div>
Purpose: A division or a section in an HTML document. It is used to group larger blocks of content for styling purposes (with CSS) or to group together elements for layout adjustments.
8. <a>
Purpose: Represents a hyperlink, linking to another page or location. You can link to pages within your site or to external sites. Attributes like href (link destination), target (how to open the link), and rel (relationship between current and linked URLs) enhance its functionality and security.
9. <img>
Purpose: Embeds an image into the webpage. Key attributes include src (the path to the image file) and alt (alternative text that describes the image, crucial for accessibility and SEO).
10. <ul>, <li>
Purpose: <ul> defines an unordered list, while <li> is used for each list item. Great for grouping related items visually, improving readability and structure.
11. <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>
Purpose: <table> creates a table. <tr> denotes a table row, <th> a table header (with bold and centered text by default), and <td> a table cell. Tables organize data efficiently but should be used judiciously as they can be less responsive on mobile devices.
